I've been using GIT before, but over 90% of this using was "git commit" and "git push" :) Some git commands I used for the first time in this course.

It's funny: in some GIT course, that I've learned before, I've been told that "rebase" and "cherry-pick" are onle extreme case commands and using them is a sign that there's something wrong in team's GIT FLOW. Still, I hope that I will not need to use them in real life.
