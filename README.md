I've been using GIT before, but over 90% of this using was "git commit" and "git push" :) Some git commands I used for the first time in this course.

It's funny: in some GIT course, that I've learned before, I've been told that "rebase" and "cherry-pick" are only extreme case commands and using them is a sign that there's something wrong in team's GIT FLOW. Still, I hope that I will not need to use them in real life.

I've been a system administrator for more than 10 year, I worked with Linux on servers and on my own computer, so I already knew much of what was in the lessons. But there was one exception: I never used any printer command on Linux :)
I really think that Linux is quite ready for "home using" and there are many useful tools for common people to solve their computer problems and needs in Linux without command line interface.

There are many commands in Linux, so you can use "cat", "more" or "less" depending on your habit in some cases, or you can use different keys for "ps", for example I prefer "ps -e" to see processes from all users of the computer.

I've changed my mind about git rebase :) I think I will use it in my work.

Besides, I realized that there are a lot of interesting points in cooperative working with GitHub.


## Intro to HTML and CSS

I already knew much of what was in these tutorials, but it was helpful to read it again, especially about rarely used tags like **thead** and **tfoot**.
Anyway, I am pleasantly surprised of how many free and quality training courses there are.
